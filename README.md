# Week3 Random Password Generator

# Stephanie Johansson

#### The project assigned during week 3 was to create a random password generator. The password was to be between 8 and 128 characters long. The use of upper and lower case letters as well as special characters and numbers were also required. This project was given boiler plate templates for both HTML and CSS. When the "Generate Password" button is pressed, the user is prompted through a series of questions concerning preferences in their password.
